> The word "Chasing" means ["Becoming loose are my clothes yet I regret not,
For I languish and suffer for her willingly"](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%BA%BA%E9%97%B4%E8%AF%8D%E8%AF%9D#%E7%8E%8B%E5%9B%BD%E7%BB%B4%E7%BE%8E%E5%AD%A6).  
> The suffix "1020" is used only to avoid duplication of names, and [October 20th](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_20) is my birthday.
